# ShakeSearch Answers

Hey Pulley!

This document contains the answers to thew coding challenge. I have never touched Go before, but I tried my best. Hope it's fine!

## Backend
1. TestSearchCaseSensitive
The problem was that CompleteWorks in SuffixArray was case sensitive and the search query was too. The result was Lookup returned nothing.

There are a few ways to go about solving this issue, but the best approach, in my view, is making the content SuffixArray all lower case and the search query all lower case.

This was done using a new function, PopulateSuffixArray, which converted the entire byte array to a lowercase string in one go, without the need for a loop, and then converted it back to a byte array and set it as the SuffixArray. 

The reason this approach works is because the actual indexes in SuffixArray do not change, just the text content. With the text content all lower case and the search query all lower case, case is no longer an issue when it comes to searching for matches.

2. TestSearchDrunk
I will note that the test is not clear about what it is testing or what the search function is supposed to return:
*   Is it testing how many times the query appears in the text?
*   Is it testing how many 500-character intervals contain the query text? If so, can the intervals overlap and are we trying to optimize for the least amount of overlap possible?
*   What counts as the query text (ie "Drunk", "drunkard", "drunkâ€™st", "swine-drunk", "drunk?" for the query "drunk"). It's Shakespeare, so "drunk" is everywhere in multiple formats.

There is not enough information to deduce what the behavior is supposed to be. That being said, I guessed from the frontend that we wanted to paginate the results. I limited the page size to 20, which is the limit specifed in this test.

## Frontend
1. "romeo, wherefore art thou"
The backend solution to TestSearchCaseSensitive fixed this test case. Search is now case insensitive.

2. "should load more results"
I implemented local storage persistance on the frontend for the currentPage and currentRows as well as pagination on the backend. I also implemented a loadMore function and attached it to the load more button via an event listener to get load more actually doing something.
